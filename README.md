This is a simulator that models shuffles of a deck of 6 cards and then runs statistical methods to quantify randomness. It has 6 shuffles in total 3 of which are state independent (riffle, overhand, and smash) and 3 which are state dependent (interleave, Chunk, Scramble).
The state dependent shuffles do a local, intermediate or global operation depending on which card is picked
The state independent shuffle mimic the behaviour of shuffle that happen during the real life shuffle and behaviour of card orderings.
